# PacMan-in-Java

A University project in Java in a form of a starter Pacman program.

The code hasn't got the prettiest comments because the hungarian JavaDoc documentation but it works.

Some impartant notes: 
- Its only running in Eclipse at the moment.
- It has some bugs (quite a few... eg. ghost routings are quite dumb, 
  some "game ends" break the program, but a restrart fix that and the score won't be lost ecc..)
  
  
In my free time im trying to improve this project of mine, because i love Pac-Man 
but it was made for a Java course as a homework as a total begginer.
